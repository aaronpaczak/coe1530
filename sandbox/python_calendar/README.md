# Sandbox
This is our sandbox, where we can put code that we use for testing our ideas quickly and sharing it with the team.

## Quickstart
This includes `quickstart.py`, `credentials.json`, and `token.json`. Some of this was taken from Google Calendar API for Python. Run with `python quickstart.py`.
